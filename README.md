I am a 3rd year student at Vellore Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu 
and with each repository i aim to showcase things i've learned and 
worked on over time. 

Currently working on my angular skills, have a lot of experience with Front end design, 
and have also created backend projects and have a lot more on the way.
